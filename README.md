# COVID_Testing

This project was designed to simulate Stony Brook University's COVID testing procedure. I collaborated on this project with another SBU student, Derek Liu.

Stony Brook is preparing to start mass weekly testing for all students, faculty and hospital employees (approximately 28K people) using saliva tests. Since they cannot test all 28K samples, multiple tests will be mixed together in the same "pool" to be tested at once. A lab employee will put this pool in a testing "well" once it becomes available. If the well turns out negative, all the tests are negative. If the well turns out positive, they have to continue testing the remaining saliva for all the participants (also in this binary testing fashion, that is, 50% in a separate well and 50% in another well, and the process continues until all positives are found). From 1 saliva sample, they can dilute it to a fixed maximum number of samples (3-5).
